# Widgetpad v0

Hi, I'm Widget, and these are the files for my ITG dance/travel pad.

This is the "v0" version, currently in prototype status. I don't plan
on deviating too far from these plans, but there are more adjustments
I still want to make to make the pad easier to manufacture, easier to
fork the source code for, and have it perform more consistently.

You can find me on the Stamina Nation discord causing problems in #pads.

If you live in Chicago and can pass stamina 16's or higher, I would be
interested in having you try out the prototype in person for feedback.
Let me know on Discord.

## Motivation

Current pads either suck or are >$1000. LTEKs are acceptable but need
significant modding using custom microcontrollers and the fragile "penny
mod", so why not just make a new pad?

Currently it's mainly competing with Bandit's
[Build This Travel Pad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6wGYLE0YI4)
and [Bandit's Terrific Travel Pad](https://github.com/BanditsTerrificTravelPad/bttp)
budget designs.

## Specs

* Aluminum extrusion frame (2020 profile)
* 1/2 acrylic panels
* Arduino Pro Micro microcontroller (but with plans to switch to Teensy
  4.0)
* Force-sensitive resistors for configurable sensitivity
  * Allows for rather extreme sensitivity if made with good tolerances
* Optional LED grid PCBs (WS2812C LEDs)

## Requirements

### Materials

* Arduino Pro Micro or Teensy 2.0 or higher
* 4x 220 ohm resistors
* Some wire to extend FSR connections
* Panels, cut or precut:
  * Either
    * 4x 12mm thickness 280mm x 280mm acrylic panels (1/2" thickness
      11"x11") or larger
  * Or
    * 1x 280mm x 280mm precut acrylic center panel
    * 4x 280mm x 130mm precut acrylic side panels
    * 4x 130mm x 130mm precut acrylic corner panels (optional)
  * Optionally acetal (a.k.a. POM, Delrin) as a slipperier center panel
    instead of acrylic
* Aluminum extrusion (2020 profile)
* Force sensitive resistors (4x Interlink
  [200mm 408](https://buyinterlinkelectronics.com/collections/new-standard-force-sensors/products/fsr-model-408-200mm-length) or 8x Interlink
  [400](https://buyinterlinkelectronics.com/collections/new-standard-force-sensors/products/fsr-model-400)
* 12x countersunk M6x30mm bolts
* 8x hex-head M6x30mm bolts
* 4x 40mm M6 threaded rods
* 16x M6 threaded inserts for plastic
* An "engineering" filament for 3D printed parts, such as PETG, nylon,
  or polycarbonate
* Optional: cross brackets and angle brackets for stability
* Optional: rubber bumpers for floor safety and/or better pad sensitivity
* Optional: 128 [WS2812C-5050](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Light-Emitting-Diodes-LED_5050-RGBIntegrated-Light-4Pin_C114587.html) LEDs for PCBs
* Optional: 8x 1x2 2.54mm-pitch right-angle male PCB headers for PCBs
* Optional: 4x [5.04mm-pitch 1x2 screw terminals](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Screw-terminal_Ningbo-Kangnex-Elec-WJ500V-5-08-2P_C8465.html) for PCBs
* Optional: 8x [5.04mm-pitch 1x3 screw terminals](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Screw-terminal_Ningbo-Kangnex-Elec-WJ500V-5-08-3P_C72334.html) for PCBs

### Equipment

* Table saw if acrylic cutting needed
* Drill press with 6mm (1/4") drill bit and 45Â° countersink bit
* Table router and roundover bit or lots of sandpaper for smooth edges
* 4mm allen key
* 3D printer for panel mounts
* A heated tool of some sort, such as a soldering iron or a lighter and
  a rod of some type, for inserting the threaded inserts
* Soldering iron is required if assembling PCBs
* DuPont wire crimpers may be useful for making "extension cords" for
  the FSR connectors

### 3D printed parts

3D printed parts can be found in the `3d/` folder.

Parts are designed using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) with the
[BOSL2](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2) library. OpenSCAD nightlies
and BOSL2 master branch are recommended.

Corner bracket mounts will need to be 3D printed to connect the panels
to the aluminum frame.

Strong filaments, at a minimum PETG but preferably
nylon or polycarbonate will be required. Brittle filaments like PLA,
ABS, HIPS, and ASA may crack. High-rigidity TPU filaments (Shore
hardness 98A or higher) may work, but soft filaments may cause the
panels to slide during play.

A soldering iron or other heating tool will be needed to melt the
threaded inserts into the 3D printed part for the panels to connect to.

PCB mounts may also be 3D printed.

A housing will eventually be designed for the microcontroller but not
as part of v0.

### PCBs

Currently only panel PCBs exist. They will be heavily redesigned in the
future but still work acceptably in their current state.

The PCBs each hold an 8x4 grid of WS2812C LEDs. An external 5V power
source is recommended if using LEDs.

Each PCB has screw terminals for connecting the WS2812C inputs and
outputs. In addition, there are 3 positions of screw terminals and
headers for connecting one or more FSRs. Multiple FSRs would be wired
in parallel.

## Dimensions

The dimensions are currently calculated using Fusion 360, but I hate
Fusion 360 so eventually I'll change it over to OpenSCAD as well.

## Firmware

The firmware is still a work in progress and can be found at
[widget-/bttp-firmware](https://github.com/widget-/bttp-firmware). It is
a fork of Bandit's [BTTP](https://github.com/BanditsTerrificTravelPad/bttp)
pad's firmware.

Currently it supports joystick or keyboard input, and allows an arbitrary
amount of buttons with corresponding optional LED strips. Sensitivity
can be adjusted either in the firmware or with a tool such as the
[bttp-config-tool](https://github.com/BanditsTerrificTravelPad/bttp-config-tool).
